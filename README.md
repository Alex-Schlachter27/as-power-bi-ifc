# Power BI 3D
Custom Visual for **Power BI** to visualize 3D models and connect them to your data. It uses the library three.js and its fantastic [3DM loader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/3DMLoader) to visualize 3D models in power BI. It currently supports just models from Rhino3d, but the visual can be easily expanded to support other file formats.
